% [b_hat] = receive(r,plot_flag)
% Receiver program for part 1 of the project. The program should produce the
% received information bits given the samples of the received signal (sampled 
% at fs Hz.)
%
% Input:
%   r = samples of the received signal
%   plot_flag = flag for plotting [0: don't plot, 1: plot] 
%
% Output:
%   b_hat = vector containing the received information bits
